# Introduction
Use multiprocessing.Pool to train your model asynchronously.  
Please make sure that the path in ```sys.path.append("path to where you stored check_gpu_workable script")``` is changed correctly.  
```check_gpu_workable.py``` can be found [here](https://github.com/EpicTian/check_gpu_available).

# Requirements

pip3 install multiprocess
```
or
